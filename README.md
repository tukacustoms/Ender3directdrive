# Ender3directdrive
Ender 3 Direct drive kits with customs hot ends + direct drive fan ducts

This is a project related to 3d printer fan duct design using upgrade parts for ender 3/ender 3v2/ ender 3 pro/ cr10 series

# Base Hotends
Choosen inicial hotend models to make a base are e3d type, specially for the easy instalation. quality, variety and overal market in 3d printers.

it has the clamping mechanism wich gives a variety of possibilities for add ons for a simpler and a more complex fan ducts.

# Fan ducts choosed and design
main nozzle fan is is 5010 centrifugal, that gives a high flow of air pressure and performance including beein silent.

for the first project will be designing an simpler fan duct with centrifugal ducts including an air duct for the hotend heatsink, the main idea is to use centrifugal ducts with an certain angle of bein perpendicular to the overal structure of the hot end.
for a simpler project the centrifucal duct will be parallel to the structure but the front facing out, that gives an more stylish look.

here is some inspirations for the centrifugal duct design

by using the simpler fan duct design its better to use with centrifugal fan paralel to the structure to making it better to 3d model overal design and making it more easy to screw them in
